	* some API doc added to README

Revision 1.6  2001/11/19 12:44:57  majkl
	* added X509::Certificate .to_der

2001/11/18 (ossl-0.0.9)
	* all project is moved to savannah.gnu.org
	* applied patch to make yielding optional (GOTOU Yuuzou - thanks!)

2001/11/17
	* ossl_version.h - new file
	* SSL::VERSION and SSL::OPENSSL_VERSION went under OpenSSL
	* SSLSocket - connect and accept were reworked; use Mutex to protect verify_callback_proc from race condition
	* SSLSocket - new allows certificate and pkey as filename
	* ossl_x509_new_from_file() added
	* ossl_pkey_new_from_file() added
	* lib/ssl.rb added for migrations from old SSLSocket
	* lib/net/* should follow above changes

2001/11/16
	* added yielding when generating RSA key (see test/ossl_pkey.rb)
	* added yielding when generating DSA key (see test/ossl_pkey.rb)

2001/11/15
	* PKCS7::Signer - introduced
	* PKCS7 - yield Signer when verifiing data

2001/11/14
	* PKCS7 - sign is working, verify problem remains
	* X509::Store - verify_callback implemented
	* PKCS7 - verify is working!

2001/11/13
	* PKCS7 added (not fully tested, but it seems to be working)
	* some additions to X509::Store

2001/11/12
	* added set_default_paths, load_locations(path) to X509::Store
	* fixed StringValuePtr --> RSTRING()->ptr

2001/11/06 (ossl-0.0.8)
	* GOTOU Yuuzou: patches to lib/*.rb in order to mark his SSLlib as deprecated
	* lib name is now 'openssl' (not 'OpenSSL' anymore - GOTOU Yuuzou's idea)

2001/11/05
	* openssl_missing.c dropped :-))
	* PKeys reworked (Again? Am I mad???)
	* sign/verify methods for RSA/DSA - compatibility tests needed!

2001/11/02 (ossl-0.0.7)
	* GOTOU Yuuzou: remove nasty warnings - make compilation clean (Thanks!)
	* GOTOU Yuuzou: ossl_ssl.c cleanups, more error proof
	* openssl_missing.c - for easy key _dups
	* fixed completely dead ossl_pkey_new2, ossl_pkey_get_EVP_PKEY
	* fixed ExtFactory's create_extension
	* make test/ssl/svr.rb generate selfsigned cert (GOTOU Yuuzou's idea)

2001/11/01
	* Added 'protect' method to X509::Store that denies freeing internal X509_STORE_CTX
	* changed all // comments to /* */ (Gotou requested)
	* brought back .ca_file, .ca_path (Gotou requested)

2001/10/31
	* fixed serious BUG in PKey .encrypt, .decrypt
	* disabled .enc/.dec for DSA since it's not supported from OpenSSL
	* since I don't know how to _dup X509_STORE_CTX, free is disabled (SSLSocket is not segfaulting now)
	* added lib/* from Yuuzou's project (nothing changed => TODO!)
	* ported some SSL examples test/ssl/* (cli, svr, verify_cb, wget)

2001/10/30
	* fixed PKey .public?, .private?
	* SSL project from GOTOU Yuuzou <gotoyuzo@notwork.org> merged in (not tested, waiting for responce from Yuuzou)
	* API for PKey to README
	* DSS digest added (SHA for DSA)
	* some more API to README
	* really add challenge to SPKI ;-)

2001/10/29 (ossl-0.0.6)
	* openssl_missing.h added
	* PKey reworked (some methods deleted, keys made Abstract)
	* DSA keys added
	* DSS1 digest added (SHA1 for DSA)
	* PKey sign and verify added (see test/ossl_pkey.rb)

2001/10/28
	* API doc for Cipers
	* Random class and API for it to README

2001/10/27
	* Challenge added to SPKI
	* Added ChangeLog
	* Added OpenSSL module functions for RAND (seed, load_random_file, write_random_file)

2001/10/26 (ossl-0.0.5)
	* Ciphers reworked, more general approach (less classes)
	* All OpenSSL ciphers added
	* Added cipher option to RSA

2001/10/25
	* ExtensionMaker renamed to ExtensionFactory
	* First Cipher class made (#of classes will be HUGE - is this good approach???)
	* Whole project is now licenced under Ruby's licence

2001/10/23
	* OpenSSL::Netscape::SPKI added

2001/10/20 (ossl-0.0.4)
	* step ahead to merge with Gotou Yuuzou <gotoyuzo@notwork.org>'s ssl project
	* (X509::Store reworked - behave like gotoyuzo's ssl version)
	* make build on FreeBSD (remove strndup) - GOTOU Yuuzou <gotoyuzo@notwork.org> contributed

2001/10/19
	* add_extension methods added
	* all (hopefully) setters to extension= frees old extensions mem.
	* some changes to api (RSA mainly)
	* openssl.cnf parser to be dropped???
	* lib and main module renamed to OpenSSL
	* full modularization introduced (will you hate it?)

2001/10/13
	* Extensions reworked (ExtensionMaker added)
	* build fixed up (Robert Feldt <feldt@ce.chalmers.se>)
